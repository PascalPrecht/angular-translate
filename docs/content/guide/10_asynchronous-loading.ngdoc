# Asynchronous Loading

Okay, different translations for different languages is pretty cool. But it's
even better if you're able to load translations asynchronously right?
`angular-translate` has some pretty cool extensions to support asynchronous and
lazy loading of translation data. And it works like a charm.

### Asynchronous loaders
angular-translate provides a pretty clever way to tell $translate service to
load data asynchronously. To load your data from a server you have to use an
asynchronous loader, which gets invoked later at runtime when it's needed.
angular-translate comes with support for two different asynchronous loader. Both
of them are installable via Bower. Let's take a look at them!

### Using urlLoader
This is possibly the simplest way of loading translation data asynchronously.
All you have to do, is to install the `angular-translate-loader-url` extension
via Bower like this:

```
$ bower install angular-translate-loader-url
```

Once its installed, make sure you've embeded it in your HTML document. Allright,
the loader is available, we now have to tell angular-translate to use it.
`$translateProvider` provides a method called `useUrlLoader()`. Pretty straight
forward, ha? `useUrlLoader()` expects an argument that describes the endpoint
of a server that'll respond with translation data.

In addition, when using asynchronous loaders, we have to use
`$translateProvider.preferredLanguage()`, to let angular-translate know, for which
language it should load the translation data.

<pre>
$translateProvider.useUrlLoader('foo/bar.json');
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

So, what happens here? angular-translate uses the extension to transform the
given string, to a real loader function which can be invoked later at runtime,
once `$translate` service is instantiated. In addition to that, telling
angular-translate to use the language key 'en', adds the language key as request
parameter to the given loader string.

So, the example above actually requests `foo/bar.json?lang=en`. angular-translate
also notices that there isn't any translation data available at startup and will
invoke the loader automatically as soon as possible.

### Using staticFilesLoader

In case you haven't just a URL which expects a `lang` parameter to return a JSON
that contains your translations, but several localization files which match a
specific pattern, you probably want to use the
`angular-translate-loader-static-files` extension which describes the pattern of
your localization files.

Like urlLoader, you can install staticFilesLoader extension via Bower:
```
$ bower install angular-translate-loader-static-files
```

Once the package is installed and embedded, you can use `$translateProvider`
method `useStaticFilesLoader()` to tell angular-translate that it should use it.
The static files loader works a bit different. Instead of having a fix url which
just expects a `lang` paramter, you are now able to have different localization
files that match a specific pattern.

How that kind of pattern looks like, depends on your needs. To specify a pattern,
the following information is required:

* **prefix** - specifies file prefix
* **suffix** - specifies file suffix

Let's say you have two localization files `locale-de.json` and  `locale-en.json`.
You can simply use the staticFilesLoader with this pattern like this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    prefix: 'locale-',
    suffix: '.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

angular-translate will concatenate the given information to
`{{prefix}}{{langKey}}{{suffix}}`. So this will load `locale-en.json`. And again,
since there isn't any translation data available yet, it'll load it as soon as
possible automatically.

### Lazy loading at runtime

Once your app bootstraps, it'll load needed translation data asynchonously as
soon as possible. Okay, cool. But what if a user wants to change the language and
the corresponding translation data isn't also loaded yet?

In [Multi Language](#/guide/07_multi-language) you've learned, how to change the
language at runtime using `$translate.uses()`. Know what? Nothing will change when
dealing with asynchronous loaders. `$translate.uses()` checks if a translation
table for a given language key is present or not. And if not, it'll invoke the
registered loader to get it down! Lazy loading at is best!

### FOUC - Flash of untranslated content

There's one drawback when using asynchronous loaders to get your translation data
into the app. There's a little amount of time when your app launches where you
have this little kind of flickering, because your translation data isn't loaded
yet. This is actually not a bug of angular-translate, but a pretty logical behavior
since we'return executing stuff asynchronously.

To get around this, you could provide at least one language **with** your app
without having to load it asynchronously. If your app then uses this provided
language as default language, using `$translateProvider.preferredLanguage()`, you
won't have this FOUC, because the language to use is already there.

Just use a combination of `$translateProvider.translations()` and
`$translateProvider.{{whatever}}Loader` like this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.translations('en', {
    'HELLO_TEXT': 'Hello World!'
});
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    'prefix': 'locale-',
    'suffix': '.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('de');
</pre>

Let's update our sample app accordingly to use an asynchronous loader! We'll use
the staticFilesLoader. First, we have to pull the translation tables out of the
code and put them into separate locale files:

**Note:** The data is now provided as _JSON_ so make sure to put everything in
double quotes!

<pre>
// locale-en.json
{
  "HEADLINE": "What an awesome module!",
  "PARAGRAPH": "Srsly!",
  "PASSED_AS_TEXT": "Hey there! I'm passed as text value!",
  "PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE": "I'm passed as attribute value, cool ha?",
  "PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION": "Beginners! I'm interpolated!",
  "VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT": "Hi {{name}}",
  "BUTTON_LANG_DE": "german",
  "BUTTON_LANG_EN": "english"
}
</pre>

<pre>
// locale-de.json
{
  "HEADLINE": "Was für ein großartiges Modul!",
  "PARAGRAPH": "Ernsthaft!",
  "PASSED_AS_TEXT": "Hey! Ich wurde als text übergeben!",
  "PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE": "Ich wurde als Attribut übergeben, cool oder?",
  "PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION": "Anfänger! Ich bin interpoliert!",
  "VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT": "Hi {{name}}",
  "BUTTON_LANG_DE": "deutsch",
  "BUTTON_LANG_EN": "englisch"
}
</pre>

Next we setup `$translate` service using `$translateProvider`:

<pre>
// configures staticFilesLoader
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
  prefix: 'data/locale-',
  suffix: '.json'
});
// load 'en' table on startup
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
$translateProvider.useLocalStorage();
</pre>

Since we don't have to make any changes in our controllers or HTML, we are done!
Take a look at the working app:

<doc:example module="myApp">
  <doc:source>
    <script>
      var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngCookies', 'pascalprecht.translate']);

      app.config(['$translateProvider', function ($translateProvider) {
        // configures staticFilesLoader
        $translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
          prefix: 'data/locale-',
          suffix: '.json'
        });
        // load 'en' table on startup
        $translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
        $translateProvider.useLocalStorage();
      }]);

      app.controller('Ctrl', ['$translate', '$scope', function ($translate, $scope) {

        $scope.changeLanguage = function (langKey) {
          $translate.uses(langKey);
        };
      }]);
    </script>
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <h2>{{ 'HEADLINE' | translate }}</h2>
      <p>{{ 'PARAGRAPH' | translate }}</p>

      <p translate>PASSED_AS_TEXT</p>
      <p translate="PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE"></p>
      <p translate>{{ 'PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION' }}</p>
      <p translate="{{ 'PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION' }}"></p>
      <p translate="VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT" translate-values="{ name: 'PascalPrecht' }"></p>

      <button ng-click="changeLanguage('de')" translate="BUTTON_LANG_DE"></button>
      <button ng-click="changeLanguage('en')" translate="BUTTON_LANG_EN"></button>
    </div>
  </doc:source>
</doc:example>

Open up your browsers devtools and take a look at the network activities when changing
the language. Our app now loads translation data asynchronously! In the next
chapter you'll learn how to build **your own custom loaders**.
